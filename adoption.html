					<h2>DOGS</h2>

						<div class="alvin">

							<h3>Alvin</h3>
							<p>
								Alvin is a great little dog, but is still working on his confidence levels. We think he would do well
								either on his own, or with another confident, outgoing dog who would encourage Alvin to become more of
								a pet himself. While under our care, he is learning to walk on a lead, and seems happy enough to be a
								student! With this in mind, we would like Alvin to go to someone who has the patience and energy needed
								to continue Alvinâ€™s training to turn him into a great pet. We will continually test him with other dogs,
								and eventually cats to give him the best possibility of rehoming. He is fully vaccinated and neutered,
								and ready to start a new life. BACKGROUND: Alvin was removed from a property where he was accompanied
								by over thirty other dogs in unsuitable living conditions. He was underweight from having to share
								inadequate amounts of food with several other dogs, and his coat was in very bad condition, but is improving
								with time since his arrival at the NAC. If this beautiful boy is the one for you, you can complete
								an application form with this <a class ="linkform" href="adoptionform.html">link</a>,
								or you can call us on 089 1234567 or email <a class ="linkform" href="mailto:info@lasthope.ie">info@lasthope.ie</a>.
								Your new best friend could be waiting.

							<h3>Chip</h3>
							<p>
								Chip is a great little dog, waiting patiently for a fresh start. He is loving and friendly, and
								would make a great pet in a caring home. He is neutered, vaccinated and microchipped, all ready
								for a new life. He would be suitable as a lone pet or with others, once he is tested with any potential
								housemates. He can also be tested with cats and horses to give him the best opportunity at rehoming.
								Chip has never been around children so a home with older children who will give him space would be ideal.
								Can you give Chip a chance at a new life? BACKGROUND: Chip was removed from a property where there
								were over thirty dogs in unsuitable living conditions. He and his friends had to share tiny amounts of
								food, and had very little shelter, but he is adjusting well to life here at the NAC. If Chip is the one
								for you, you can complete an application form with this <a class ="linkform" href="adoptionform.html">link</a>,
								or you can call us on 089 1234567 or <a class ="linkform" href="mailto:info@lasthope.ie">info@lasthope.ie</a>.

					<h2>CATS</h2>

							<h3>Randy</h3>
							<p>
								Randy is a fantastic lad looking for his own second chance. He has bags of character and will make a
								wonderful addition to his new home. He would be ideally suited to an adopter who is looking for a
								cat who can be in & outdoors. He would be in his element in the country side, well off main roads
								with lots of adventures ahead of him. He is in good health, is now neutered and will soon be ready
								to start his new life. He adores interaction & lots of love, this big boy has an adorable nature.
								He can be gradually introduced to other cats on his new home, ideally with a female for company.
								Can you offer our lovely boy Randy the loving home he deserves? Background; Randy was found during
								the recent snow storms in a collapsed state, he had been in a few wars but due to the adverse weather
								conditions he was in serious risk of losing his life. He was being monitored by a caring local lady
								who couldn't catch him, thankfully he was caught in time and has since made a full recovery. He has
								been fully vet assessed and cleared for adoption. He is currently located in Donegal and if you would
								like to offer him a home please contact on 089 1234567 or email
								<a class ="linkform" href="mailto:info@lasthope.ie">info@lasthope.ie</a> for more details.

							<h3>Roger</h3>
							<p>
								Roger is a very large handsome tabby cat, recently neutered, so he has the jowls of the entire male cat.
								He was made homeless when his foster family moved house. He is friendly and chatty, gets along with
								other cats and is very confident. He is now neutered, micro chipped,, vaccinated and uses his litter tray.
								If you can offer him a home and would like to meet him, please telephone 089 1234567. It is our policy
								that cats sleep indoors overnight throughout the lives which means providing Roger with a litter tray.
								if you would like to offer him a home please contact on 089 1234567 or email

								<h3>Frannie and Flynn</h3>
								<p>
									Frannie and Flynn are an adorable bonded couple who find comfort in each other. They are little shy
									however are very curious about humans (especially ones with treats!) and both enjoy head and ear rubs.
									Shy at first, this bonded pair likes to stay close to each other until Frannie signals the coast is
									clear and it's time to find someone for pets. They love playing hide-and-seek, getting lots of pets,
									and being the calmest bunnies around. House Rabbit Society is a rescue & educational organization.
									We welcome new and experienced bunny guardians. We have 30+ rescued rabbits at House Rabbit Society
									and our experts will help you find the perfect rabbit.

								<h3>Rose</h3>
								<p>

									Rose by name but not by nature. She is a full time lover of cuddles and snuggles. Her ruby red
									eyes are full of sparkle and light. She is affectionate, trusting and gentle. A gorgeous bunny
									inside and out. Here's what her fosterer has to say about her: "Rose is a true delight. She is
									inquisitive, fun and charismatic. She loves to roam various rooms in a house while alternating laps
									with human interaction. Rose is a snuggly bed bunny (what a treat!) that would thrive in an
									environment with a patient, interactive human (including a young adult) who loves to hang out with
									a bunny on a mission that ultimately, ends every session with lots of human attention." House Rabbit
